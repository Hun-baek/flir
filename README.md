## Description of the project

This project is meant to apply Scalar-on-Function Linear Instrumental Regression (SoFLIR) that I introdueced in my Master's thesis entitled "Scalar-on-Function Linear Instrumental Regression". The thesis had several parts that can be improved such as adding a constant term, and omitting both week days and change days of summer time. In this project, the finely measured electricity data in New York motivates to derive timely volatile price elasticity in energy market with SoFLIR. The response is consumption, the regressor is granually measured electricity price, and the instrument is electricity generated by wind and hydro system.

## Usage
This project was created with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
and the [econ-project-templates](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates). The project was written on Windows 10 using

* Python 3.9.16

To get started, create and activate the environment with

```console
$ conda env create -f "environment.yml"
$ conda activate flir
```

To build the project, type

```console
$ pytask
```

## Struture of the project

If you run ```$ pytask```, all outputs will be created from the code chunks and data in /src and stored into /bld except for the paper.
The paper will be generated into /paper.
