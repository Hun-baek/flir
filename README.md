## Description of the project

This project aims to apply Scalar-on-Function Linear Instrumental Regression (SoFLIR), which was introduced in my Master's thesis entitled "Scalar-on-Function Linear Instrumental Regression". The thesis had several parts that can be improved, such as adding a constant term and omitting weekdays and days when time changes due to summer time. In this project, the finely measured electricity data in New York will be used to derive timely and volatile price elasticity in the energy market using SoFLIR. The response variable is consumption, the regressor is the granularly measured electricity price, and the instrument is electricity generated by wind and hydro systems.

## Usage
This project was created with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
and the [econ-project-templates](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates). The project was written on Windows 10 using

* Python 3.9.16

To get started, first clone this repositary.

Navigate to the repositary folder.

Create and activate the environment with
```console
$ conda env create -f "environment.yml"
$ conda activate flir
```

To build the project, type

```console
$ pytask
```

## Struture of the project

If you run ```$ pytask```, all outputs will be created from the code chunks and data in /src and stored into /bld except for the paper.
The paper will be generated into /paper.
If you run ```$ pytest```, it will test functions in /test.
